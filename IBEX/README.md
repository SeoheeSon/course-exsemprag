## IBEX Tutorial

Day 1 will cover the basics of creating simple acceptability judgement or other types of forced-choice task experiments. We will do a mini-replication of experiment 1  reported in our reading, Brasoveanu & Dotlacil (2015). For a comprehensive step-by step guide, please consult [Brian Dillon and Rodica Ivan's LSA tutorial](https://xlingumass.github.io/resources/LSA_Minicourse_DillonIvan.pdf). The [official IBEX manual](https://github.com/addrummond/ibex/blob/master/docs/manual.md) will also be of use.

# Getting started

To create a new experiment, log in to your account in [IBEX Farm](http://spellout.net/ibexfarm/) and click on *Create a new experiment*.
For a basic experiment, all you need to modify will be the javascript file under:

``` 
    data_includes
```

There are four main parts you want to keep in mind.

* Define experimental trials and filler/practice trials, represent them as items variables
* Define shuffleSequence and determine the general flow of the experiment
* Define controller defaults
* Add introductions and exits

# Trials as item variables

Commonly used controllers are `AcceptabilityJudgement` and `Question

``` 
    data_includes
```
